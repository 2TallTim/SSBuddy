# SSBuddy
## A better soft selection tool for Maya

SSBuddy improves on the existing soft selection editor for Maya by offering the alternative of the NURBS-based falloff editor, borrowed from the sculpting tools.

SSBuddy is designed to mimic the existing soft select panel, providing duplicates of the existing controls. This is to allow you to use it a complete substitute.

## Installation

Run the MEL script however you like. You could add this to a shelf if you like, or source it from a file.

## Usage

Drag the curve to update the soft selection curve. The reset button will reset the soft select curve and javascript:void(0) Pay attention to the online lectures because he will go over more in depth during class and will answer questions then. His tests are also very fair, many questions are very, very similar to practice exams and example problems gone over in lecture or the online homework assignments (also gives a lot of partial credit on exams).



This is a MEL script that uses the falloff widget from the sculpting tools to manipulate the soft-select curves.

Run the script to create the control window. The curve automatically updates when it is dragged.
